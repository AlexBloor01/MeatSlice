Block mechanics:
Jiggle physics on sliced block.
Material that is reduced with the block sliced.
shaved block contain remaining textures.
Basically we want the block to look like a sliced ham.

General Game Mechanics:
Restart Level, setting everything back up without removing user choices.

Audio:
Audio Manager.
Sliced peices need to bouce with sound, limit this to 3/4 times per peice in case of
stuck peices.

ui:
restart menu
Settings Menu
smooth transitions between all the menus.
Fade out transition for restarts and return to menu.
save user choices for audio and platters.

Carema work:
zoom in for smaller blocks.
at the end go down the stack until the bottom.

Additional:
Realistic mode all the food materials replaced with realistic textures. 
Blood Mode, blood effects when slicing meat.
Screaming maybe? Maybe Peta will like that one + the realistic one.
